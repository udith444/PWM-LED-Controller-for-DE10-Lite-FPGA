# PWM Controller for DE10-Lite FPGA

## Project Overview
This project implements a Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) controller on the DE10-Lite FPGA board. It controls LED brightness using three toggle switches to adjust the duty cycle in 8 steps (12.5% increments). The design includes:

- **PWM Generator**: 1024-level resolution (0.1% granularity)
- **Debounced Inputs**: Reliable switch readings
- **PLL Clock Management**: Converts 50 MHz system clock to 10 MHz (PWM) and 30 kHz (duty-cycle update)

## Key Features
ðŸ”„ **Duty Cycle Control**:
- `SW[0]`: +12.5%
- `SW[1]`: -12.5%
- `SW[2]`: Reset to 0%

ðŸ’¡ **Outputs**:
- `LED[0]`: PWM-driven LED (variable brightness)
- Arduino GPIO Pin: PWM signal for external use

## Hardware Testing
1. Toggle switches `SW[0]`â€“`SW[2]` to adjust LED brightness
2. Observe `LED[0]` brightness levels:

| Switches (SW[2:0]) | Duty Cycle | Brightness Level |
|--------------------|------------|------------------|
| 000                | 0%         | Off              |
| 001                | 12.5%      | Low              |
| 010                | 25%        | Medium-Low       |
| 011                | 37.5%      | Medium           |
| 100                | 50%        | Medium-High      |
| 101                | 62.5%      | High             |
| 110                | 75%        | Very High        |
| 111                | 100%       | Full             |

## Simulation
To verify the design in ModelSim:
1. Set `pwm_led_top.v` as the top-level entity
2. Run `Tools â†’ Run Simulation Tool â†’ RTL Simulation`
3. Force SW inputs in the waveform window to test PWM behavior
